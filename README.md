This project is developed using googlesheet as database and the sheet data is fetched using the sheet's app script and javascript.
The sheet columns have a particular order and that order must be followed strictly(topic, difficulty, name, youtube link, practice link, notes).
The project also have the function to show search suggestion from the existing sheet data.
The add problem and add notes are password protected because the website is not for multiusers.
